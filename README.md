# Introduction
Pulse Sensor is a well-designed plug-and-play heart-rate sensor for Arduino. It can be used by many who want to easily incorporate live heart rate data into their projects. It also includes an open-source monitoring app that graphs your pulse in real time.

# Budget

<br/>
A full list of materials along with a detailed view of costs can be downloaded form within this repository.[budget.docx](https://github.com/baltejbal/SWATCH/blob/master/budget.xlsx)<br/>
<br/>
The total cost of producing this project is heavily inflated due to the cost of the soldering kit that was supplied in the lab during
development. Any generic solding iron can be used for this project.</br>
<br/>
The total cost after removing the soldering kit is: **$ 129.51 CAD** after HST. This includes all the tools used in completing the project (eg. wirecutters, needlenose pliers, breadboard, etc.)</br>

Notable purchases include: Raspberry Pi 3B+ Kit ($74.29 CAD) and Sen-11574 Pulse Rate Sensor ($23.28 CAD).
