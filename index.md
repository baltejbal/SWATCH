    <p> Hello. As we hit week 8 of the Pulse sensor build, I’d like to keep you up to speed on what’s happening. For starters the week 7 PCB milestone has been completed to see the design please see below. In terms of financial status all parts have been purchased with the exception of the heart rate sensor but before we return from reading week I will have it as it is arriving on time. Furthuremore, it is possible that revisions may be need for the PCB board as things may change but for now it is completed.<b><br><br><b>Breadboard:</b><br> "https://github.com/baltejbal/PICS/blob/master/PULSE%20SENSOR_bb.png?raw=true<br><b>Schematic:</b> <br>https://github.com/baltejbal/PICS/blob/master/PULSE%20SENSOR_schem.png?raw=true<br><b>PCB:</b><br>https://github.com/baltejbal/PICS/blob/master/Finalpcb_pcb.png?raw=true<br><b>.fzz file:</b><br>https://github.com/baltejbal/SWATCH/blob/master/PULSE%20SENSOR.fzz</b>
