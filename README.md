# Introduction
Pulse Sensor is a well-designed plug-and-play heart-rate sensor for Arduino. It can be used by many who want to easily incorporate live heart rate data into their projects. It also includes an open-source monitoring app that graphs your pulse in real time.

# Budget

<br/>
A full list of materials along with a detailed view of costs can be downloaded form within this repository.[budget.docx](https://github.com/baltejbal/SWATCH/blob/master/budget.xlsx)<br/>
<br/>
The total cost of producing this project is heavily inflated due to the cost of the soldering kit that was supplied in the lab during
development. Any generic solding iron can be used for this project.</br>
<br/>
The total cost after removing the soldering kit is: **$ 129.51 CAD** after HST. This includes all the tools used in completing the project (eg. wirecutters, needlenose pliers, breadboard, etc.)</br>

Notable purchases include: Raspberry Pi 3B+ Kit ($74.29 CAD) and Sen-11574 Pulse Rate Sensor ($23.28 CAD).

### MCP3008-8-Channel 10-Bit ADC with SPI Interface to convert analog/digital<br/>

Need to add analog inputs? This chip will add 8 channels of 10-bit analog input to your microcontroller or microcomputer project. It's super easy to use, and uses SPI so only 4 pins are required. I chose this chip as a great accompaniment to the Raspberry Pi computer, because its fun to have analog inputs but the Pi does not have an ADC.

# Time-Schedule

Realistically, this project should take roughly a weekend to complete if all materials and facilites are available to you. The materials themselves might take a week to arrive due to shipping, but the actual proccess of assembling and programming should not take longer than 3 days. A couple of hours each day can be dedicated towards the different aspects of the project to make time usuage more efficient and effective. For me, this project took around 1 whole semester (4 months) to finish along with an average work time of around 2.5 hours a week. Here is the time schedule I followed:
