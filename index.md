    <p>PCB soldering is complete, Raspberry Pi software has been configured as well - I am able to connect to a Pi using VNC/xRDP.
There have been no changes to the budget or the project outline up until this point. As the Pi-related parts of the project begin to wind-down (software is functional, PCB is soldered, and I am able to read data off the sensor), I am shifting focus to designing and assembling an enclosure. The enclosure is due next week, followed by the final presentation the week after.</p>

    <p>PCB Solidering is done this week</p>

    <p>Breadboard was setup and code was written to read data off the sensor and on to the Pi. I have not run into any additional   expenses so far, but the project is not going as planned. My sensor is showing an error and it does not show the BPM found it only shows the error "No Heartbeat Found". I have reset my Pi and I am restarting from scratch. PCB soldering will be done as soon as I get my sensor to read data.</p>

    <p> Hello. As we hit week 8 of the Pulse sensor build, I’d like to keep you up to speed on what’s happening. For starters the week 7 PCB milestone has been completed to see the design please see below. In terms of financial status all parts have been purchased with the exception of the heart rate sensor but before we return from reading week I will have it as it is arriving on time. Furthuremore, it is possible that revisions may be need for the PCB board as things may change but for now it is completed. </br></br>
      
No class this week as the college is closed. Raspberry Pi was configured to allow for connections over SSH and VNC, and I received my PCB from the Prototype Lab.<b><br><br><b>Breadboard:</b><br> "https://github.com/baltejbal/PICS/blob/master/PULSE%20SENSOR_bb.png?raw=true<br><b>Schematic:</b> <br>https://github.com/baltejbal/PICS/blob/master/PULSE%20SENSOR_schem.png?raw=true<br><b>PCB:</b><br>https://github.com/baltejbal/PICS/blob/master/Finalpcb_pcb.png?raw=true<br><b>.fzz file:</b><br>https://github.com/baltejbal/SWATCH/blob/master/PULSE%20SENSOR.fzz</b>
